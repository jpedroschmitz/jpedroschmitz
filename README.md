# Hello, dev!

I am a Software Developer working remotely for [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com?utm_source=jpedroschmitz). Lately, I'm developing many projects with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hey@joaopedro.dev) or send me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you. 👋🏻
