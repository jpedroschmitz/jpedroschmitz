**Hey, I'm João Pedro! 👋**

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷  working remotely for [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com). Lately, I'm making a lot of cool applications with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hey@joaopedro.dev) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you :)
