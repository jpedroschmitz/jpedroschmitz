# Hello, dev!

I build applications with JavaScript. Lately, I'm making many useful things with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to open source, that's the reason I help to maintain projects like [Unform](https://github.com/Rocketseat/unform) and [Gatsby Themes](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-themes).

Currently, I am working at [Rocketseat](https://bit.ly/2BJNrGc). If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:oi@joaopedro.cc) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz). Looking forward to connecting with you 👋🏻
