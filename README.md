**Hey, I'm JoÃ£o Pedro! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Software Developer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· working remotely for [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com). Lately, I'm making a lot of cool applications with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hey@joaopedro.dev) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you :)
