# Hello, dev!

I am an Open Source developer working remotely for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br?utm_source=joaopedro). Lately, I've been working on many projects, like [Omni](https://github.com/getomni), [Unform](https://github.com/unform/unform), [Adonis Bull](https://github.com/Rocketseat/adonis-bull), [Gatsby Themes](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-themes), and many others that you can check on my profile.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hey@joaopedro.dev) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you 👋🏻
