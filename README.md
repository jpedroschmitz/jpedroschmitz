# Hello, dev!

I build applications with _JavaScript_. Lately, I'm making as many useful things with _React_ and _Next.js_ as I can. I love sharing knowledge and contributing to open source, that's the reason I help to maintain projects like [Unform](https://github.com/Rocketseat/unform), [Gatsby Themes](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-themes) and others.

I work at [Rocketseat](https://bit.ly/2BJNrGc), too. If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:oi@joaopedro.cc) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz). Looking forward to meet you 👋🏻
