**Hey, I'm João Pedro! 👋**

I'm a Front-End Engineer from Brazil 🇧🇷. I create a lot of cool applications with React and Next.js. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects. Here are some of my most recent projects:

- 🆕 [Nova Bible](https://novabible.app/), a distraction-free Bible app focused entirely on Scripture. Clean, calm, beautifully designed reading.
- [FreeInvoice.dev](https://FreeInvoice.dev), a simple and Free Invoice Tool to create professional invoices;
- [Vagas Chapecó](https://vagaschapeco.com), a job board tailored to the region where I live in Brazil.

You can reach out to me directly on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jpedroschmitz) or [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/jpedroschmitz). Looking forward to connecting with you :)
