**Hey, I'm JoÃ£o Pedro! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a Front-End Engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I create a lot of cool applications with React, Next.js, and Remix. I also love sharing knowledge and contributing to Open Source projects. Here are some of my most recent projects:

- [Flux](https://nextlevelthemes.com), a professional Ghost Theme created for developers;
- [FreeInvoice.dev](https://FreeInvoice.dev), a simple and Free Invoice Tool to create professional invoices;
- [vagaschapeco.com](https://vagaschapeco.com), a job board tailored to the region where I live in Brazil.

If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me [an email](mailto:hey@joaopedro.dev) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jpedroschmitz) (the best way to talk with me). I'm looking forward to connecting with you :)
